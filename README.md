# Zero
Zero is my discord bot. With him you can know some Minecraft craftings, ban people and much more! With Zero on GitHub, you can now help on the development of my bot and much more!

Zero is built in JS (JavaScript) and you can find some "hidden things" on them!

Also, Zero is a brazillian bot, so if you want to help me, know some portuguese and start helping!

# How to start helping?
**First of all you need to have Node.js, discord.js and VSCode (Visual Studio Code).**

You can install Node.js on their site: [Node.js's Installer Site](https://nodejs.org/en/)

## Windows
To install discord.js, open the command prompt as admininstrator, and write this code:
```batch
npm install discord.js
```
And now wait to install.
After installing discord.js, you now only need a text editor. It's recommended that you use Visual Studio Code to run the code, for running the code, use Code Runner extension.

You can install VSCode on their site: [VSCode's Installer Site](https://code.visualstudio.com/Download)

## And now it's time to code!
After installing everything you can now code, help everything and it's done!
