# Renzo
Renzo is a easy-to-use and yet user-friendly Discord bot with functions for your server!

# ü§î How to contribute to Renzo?
**You will need:**
- A text editor (for example: Visual Studio Code, Atom)
- Have a little knowledge of JavaScript and discord.js
- Have node.js v16 installed

If you don't have node.js installed, you can install node.js by downloading at the [node.js website](https://nodejs.org/en/).

Don't have a text editor installed? Install Visual Studio Code by downloading at the [Visual Studio Code website](https://code.visualstudio.com/Download).

## üë©‚Äçüíª How do I start contributting?
Make sure you have all the programs and dependencies installed, without them you can't start contributting.

Firstly, we need to install the discord.js module. You can install the discord.js module by simply writing this command in your Command Prompt:
```batch
npm install discord.js
```
After that, the module will be installed. If you see an error about Windows not recognizing 'npm', make sure to reinstall node.js and try the command again.

## ‚úçÔ∏è Happy coding!
After all of this, you can now contribute to Renzo! Help us make the world a easier place for everyone!
